## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. **Temperature Sensor**: Continuously monitors the drink's temperature.
2. **Microcontroller**: Reads sensor data and calculates the required heating power.
3. **PID Control Loop**: A closed-loop control system calculates the error between current and target temperature, adjusting the PWM duty cycle for smooth and accurate heating.
4. **PWM Control with MOSFET Switching**: A power MOSFET (e.g., IRF540N) switches the heating element on and off rapidly based on the PID output, ensuring efficient and safe power delivery.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Automatically adjusts heating in real time to preserve beverage quality and extend battery life.
