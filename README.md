## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. **Temperature Sensor**: Continuously monitors the drink's temperature.
2. **Microcontroller**: Processes temperature data and adjusts power delivery.
3. **PWM Control with MOSFET Switching**: A power MOSFET is used to switch the heating element on and off rapidly using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), delivering just enough energy to maintain the desired temperature.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Automatically adjusts heating in real time to preserve beverage quality and extend battery life.
